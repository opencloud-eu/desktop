    As a user
    I want to be able to edit the file content
    So that I can modify and change file data

#    Background:
#        Given user "Alice" has been created in the server with default attributes
#
#
#    Scenario: Modify original content of a file with special character
#        Given user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "openCloud test text file 0" to "S@mpleFile!With,$pecial&Characters.txt" in the server
#        And user "Alice" has set up a client with default settings
#        When the user overwrites the file "S@mpleFile!With,$pecial&Characters.txt" with content "overwrite openCloud test text file"
#        And the user waits for file "S@mpleFile!With,$pecial&Characters.txt" to be synced
#        Then as "Alice" the file "S@mpleFile!With,$pecial&Characters.txt" should have the content "overwrite openCloud test text file" in the server
#
#
#   Scenario: Modify original content of a file
#        Given user "Alice" has set up a client with default settings
#        When user "Alice" creates a file "testfile.txt" with the following content inside the sync folder
#            """
#            test content
#            """
#		And the user waits for file "testfile.txt" to be synced
#        And the user overwrites the file "testfile.txt" with content "overwrite openCloud test text file"
#        And the user waits for file "testfile.txt" to be synced
#        Then as "Alice" the file "testfile.txt" should have the content "overwrite openCloud test text file" in the server
#
#
#   Scenario: Replace and modify the content of a pdf file multiple times
#     Given user "Alice" has set up a client with default settings
#     And the user has copied file "simple.pdf" from outside the sync folder to "/" in the sync folder
